        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-brandPrimary mt-6 mb-3">What Are Mutual Funds?</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to purchase securities like stocks, bonds, and other assets. Professional fund managers oversee these investments, making strategic decisions to maximize returns based on the fund's stated objectives. This collective approach enables individual investors to access diversified portfolios that might otherwise be unaffordable or difficult to manage.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-brandPrimary mt-6 mb-3">Types of Mutual Funds in India</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Indian mutual fund market offers diverse investment options tailored to various risk profiles and financial goals:
        </p>
        
        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-brandPrimary mt-4 mb-2">Equity Funds</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          These funds primarily invest in stocks, offering high growth potential with corresponding higher risk. They are ideal for investors with long-term horizons and higher risk tolerance. Historical average returns range from 12-15% annually over extended periods, though performance varies significantly with market conditions.
        </p>
        
        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-brandPrimary mt-4 mb-2">Debt Funds</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Focusing on fixed-income securities like government bonds, corporate bonds, and money market instruments, debt funds offer more stable returns with lower risk. These typically yield 7-9% annually and are suitable for conservative investors or those with shorter investment horizons.
        </p>
        
        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-brandPrimary mt-4 mb-2">Hybrid Funds</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Balancing equity and debt investments, hybrid funds provide moderate risk with potential for reasonable growth. Balanced advantage funds and aggressive hybrid funds are popular choices, typically generating 9-12% annual returns depending on their asset allocation strategies.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-brandPrimary mt-6 mb-3">The Power of SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Systematic Investment Plans have revolutionized mutual fund investing in India by allowing investors to contribute fixed amounts regularly (typically monthly). This approach offers several advantages:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Rupee Cost Averaging:</strong> By investing fixed amounts regularly, investors purchase more units when prices are low and fewer when prices are high, potentially lowering the average cost per unit.</li>
          <li><strong>Disciplined Investing:</strong> SIPs enforce financial discipline by automating regular investments, removing emotional decision-making from the equation.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> With minimums as low as ₹500 monthly, SIPs make mutual fund investing accessible to most income levels.</li>
          <li><strong>Compounding Benefits:</strong> Regular investments over time maximize the power of compounding, where returns generate additional returns.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-brandPrimary mt-6 mb-3">Understanding Taxation of Mutual Funds in India</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Tax implications vary based on the type of fund and holding period:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Equity Funds:</strong> Short-term capital gains (held less than 12 months) are taxed at 15%, while long-term gains exceeding ₹1 lakh annually are taxed at 10% without indexation benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>Debt Funds:</strong> Short-term gains (held less than 36 months) are added to income and taxed at the applicable slab rate. Long-term gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>ELSS Funds:</strong> These equity-linked savings schemes offer tax deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh under Section 80C with a mandatory 3-year lock-in period.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-brandPrimary mt-6 mb-3">Factors to Consider When Investing</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Beyond the calculator's projections, successful mutual fund investing requires consideration of:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Investment Horizon:</strong> Align fund choices with your time frame; equity for long-term goals and debt for shorter periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong> Honestly assess your comfort with market fluctuations to avoid panic decisions during downturns.</li>
          <li><strong>Expense Ratios:</strong> Lower expense ratios directly impact net returns, especially over long periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Fund Manager Expertise:</strong> Evaluate the track record and experience of fund managers across market cycles.</li>
          <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Spread investments across asset classes, sectors, and fund houses to mitigate risk.</li>
        </ul>
